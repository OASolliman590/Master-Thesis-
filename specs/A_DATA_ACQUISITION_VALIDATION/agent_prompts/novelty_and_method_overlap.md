# Novelty and method-overlap agent

## Task

Audit whether candidate cohorts, signatures, predictors or atlas-derived features were used in prior development, tuning or validation and whether the proposed acquisition/method duplicates existing work.

## Required proposed records

- method/signature name and exact version;
- training, feature-selection, tuning and validation cohorts;
- atlas/reanalysis relationships;
- overlap with proposed Paper A branches;
- contamination implication;
- closest methodological precedent and remaining distinction;
- evidence gaps.

A method paper’s use of a cohort changes exposure status even when the local repository path is new.


## Operating constraints

You are a **read-only** evidence agent. Do not edit the canonical registry, admission decisions, split registry or patient ontology. Return a compact structured output packet to the integrator.

- Use original publications, supplements, official repositories and trial records first.
- Separate VERIFIED FACT, INFERENCE, DESIGN IMPLICATION and UNKNOWN.
- Every factual field requires a source locator.
- Do not invent patient counts, pairings, endpoints, timings, hashes, permissions or independence.
- A landing page is not a retrieved matrix.
- Preserve unresolved conflicts.
- Do not include credentials, signed URLs or restricted patient records.

## Structured output

Return UTF-8 JSON matching this envelope:

```json
{{
  "packet_id": "LANE-query-result-version",
  "lane": "...",
  "query_ids": ["..."],
  "candidate_label": "...",
  "verified_facts": [{{"claim": "...", "source_locator": {{"kind": "URL|DOI|PMID|FILE", "value": "...", "page_or_section": null}}}}],
  "inferences": [{{"statement": "...", "supporting_fact_indices": [0]}}],
  "unknowns": [{{"field": "...", "resolution_path": "...", "blocking_branches": ["..."]}}],
  "proposed_records": {{ }},
  "suspected_overlap": [],
  "recommended_next_action": "...",
  "agent_id": "...",
  "completed_utc": "..."
}}
```

Use `UNKNOWN`, not a guessed value. The integrator alone merges proposed records into canonical registries.
